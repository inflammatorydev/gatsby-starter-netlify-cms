If there’s one thing you can say about me, it’s that I love running. A lot.

\
I love kicking up dust along a coastal trail on a sunny day with the ocean sparkling in the distance, or stepping out of my front door for fifty miles through the oak-forested hills, once in a while, just because.

\
I love running with my dog, Zooey, and, before she passed over the rainbow bridge, Wasatch, the sweet abandoned puppy whom I first met in the mountains of Utah.

\
I love running with and crewing friends during difficult races or pacing a complete stranger through the cold night of their first hundred-mile ultra marathon. My passion is helping others find their own passion through running!

Online Coaching: Personalized Run Coaching Service\*\*

This plan is for runners who are interested in a fully customized training schedule, updated each week based on how the previous week’s training went. We will make ourselves available to answer all of your questions via email, phone (twice monthly) and text message as needed.

**How does Online Running Coaching work?**

We’ll begin with a phone consultation. Before we build your first training schedule, we will want to get to know more about your background and goals. We’ll discuss your injury history, diet, knowledge of running and past experience. You’ll tell us your short and long-term goals and aspirations. The ultimate purpose of this phone call is to build a solid training plan that helps you reach and exceed all of your running goals! After your consultation, we will put together a training schedule that is personalized for you. It will take into consideration your current running level, experience and life schedule. The first week of training will be posted to an online training log. There is a section in the log for you to write notes about each day’s training so I can better understand how the workout went and if any adjustments are necessary. It’s important that you are very honest with us in the notes. We need to know if you are experiencing any injuries or discomfort so that we can take steps to avoid injury.

Initial phone consultation to review athlete’s history and goals
Customized training schedule with daily workouts
