I learned early from my parents that the best reward for working hard to achieve your passion is the opportunity to give something back. My father was a retired educator and coach.  He always worked hard to share his knowledge and help his students succeed. My mother was an extraordinary woman, a zoologist who earned a Masters from Stanford in 1955 and a Ph.D. from Cal in 1959 when it was very rare for a woman to succeed in the sciences .
